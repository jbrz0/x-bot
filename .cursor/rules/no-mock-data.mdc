# Production-Quality Rule: No Mock Data or Temporary Solutions

This rule mandates that all generated code must be fully production-ready. No mock data, placeholder values, or temporary quick-fix solutions are allowed. If a complete and robust solution isnâ€™t achievable, the system must instead produce an error so that the issue can be addressed properly.

No Mock Data:
- Do not generate or include any mock data or dummy values in any code or example.
- All data should reflect real-world, applicable scenarios.

No Temporary Solutions:
- Avoid any hacky, provisional, or quick-fix implementations solely to get a server or app running.
- Every solution must be robust and final, adhering to production standards.

Error on Incompletion:
- If a complete, production-level solution cannot be provided, the AI must return an error rather than resorting to any temporary or mock implementations.

Enforcement:
- This rule applies universally across all file types and contexts. Any deviation should immediately result in an error, prompting a fix that aligns with these strict guidelines.
